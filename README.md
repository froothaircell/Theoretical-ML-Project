# Comparative Study on Deep Learning Models for Semi-Supervised Bounding Box Regression

Welcome to the repository for **Comparative Study on Deep Learning Models for Semi-Supervised Bounding Box Regression**. This repository contains the code, datasets, and analysis for evaluating the performance of different deep learning architectures in semi-supervised bounding box regression tasks.

---

## Overview

Bounding box regression is essential for object detection tasks in computer vision, enabling precise localization of objects. While supervised methods require extensive labeled datasets, this study explores the semi-supervised approach, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. Our work compares the performance of four prominent deep learning architectures under these conditions.

## Key Features

### Deep Learning Models Evaluated
- MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron): Baseline feed-forward architecture.
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: Captures local spatial features effectively.
- Vision Transformer (ViT)**: Utilizes self-attention mechanisms for global context.
- Transformer Encoder: A versatile architecture for capturing dependencies.

### **Dataset**
- **Modified COCO 2017 Dataset**: Adapted for semi-supervised learning by introducing unlabeled data.  
  Preprocessing includes normalization and resizing to \(224 \times 224\).

### **Evaluation Metrics**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R-squared (\(R^2\))**

### **Highlights**
- Automated preprocessing pipeline for data preparation.
- Comparative analysis of model performance on semi-supervised tasks.
- Insights into trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy, and generalization.
